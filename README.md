# Triad Analyzer: Find Yourself in Others

**«I don’t love you, I love myself in you.»**

This project is a gift to the world — a way to find compatibility between people using just a smartphone camera and microphone. No personal data, no discrimination, just science! We analyze three signals:
- **Eye movements** (microsaccades): Tiny, unique eye twitches that reflect your brain’s activity.
- **Voice**: The melody of your emotions.
- **Heart rhythm** (HRV): Your body’s unique pulse.

By comparing these signals, we tell you if two people are "on the same wavelength." It’s like finding a piece of yourself in someone else.

## Why It Works
Science backs us up:
- **Eyes**: Microsaccades are unique and tied to your brain (Martinez-Conde, 2013, *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*).
- **Voice**: Reveals your emotions (Ulanovsky, 2008, *Trends in Neurosciences*).
- **Heart**: HRV is your body’s fingerprint (Goldberger, 2002, *American Journal of Physiology*).
- **Smartphones**: Modern cameras and mics can capture this data (Baltrušaitis, 2016, *IEEE WACV*; Zhang, 2019, *IEEE Transactions*).
- **Compatibility**: Similar brain and body patterns mean harmony (Tononi, 2016, *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*).

## How to Use
1. Record a short video (2 sec) and audio (“Hi!”) with your smartphone.
2. The app creates a “personality code” from your eyes, voice, and heart.
3. Compare codes with another person to see: “Compatible (85%)” or “Not compatible.”

## Get Started

# Scientific Foundation
The Triad Analyzer is grounded in science:
- **Microsaccades**: Unique eye movements tied to brain activity (Martinez-Conde, 2013, DOI: 10.1038/nrn3388; Hafed, 2015, DOI: 10.1038/nn.3989).
- **Voice**: Reflects emotions and cognition (Ulanovsky, 2008, DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2007.11.003).
- **HRV**: A physiological fingerprint (Goldberger, 2002, DOI: 10.1152/ajpheart.00406.2001).
- **Smartphone feasibility**: Cameras and mics can capture these signals (Baltrušaitis, 2016, DOI: 10.1109/WACV.2016.7477553; Zhang, 2019, DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2018.2876057).
- **Compatibility**: Similar patterns indicate harmony (Tononi, 2016, DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.44).
